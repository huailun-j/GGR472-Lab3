## 🚴‍♂️ Toronto Cycling and Bicycle Parking Capacity

### 🌟 Project Overview
This web page is designed to help Toronto cyclists understand bicycle parking capacity and the distribution of cycling network in the city. By visualizing this data, the webpage aims to provide cyclists with detailed information about bike parking facilities and cycling routes, thereby promoting cycling as a sustainable, healthy and efficient mode of transportation. At the same time, it encourages residents to use bicycles more often, reducing their dependence on cars and contributing to a greener urban environment.


### 🌍 Purpose
The webpage can provide cyclists with detailed information about bicycle parking capacity, location and cycling network within the City of Toronto. By providing this data, cyclists can better plan their trips, find appropriate parking facilities, and choose safe cycling routes.
